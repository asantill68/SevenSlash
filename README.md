🌱 I’m currently learning/reviewing HTML and CSS in this repo started in March 2021.

Hunting Ranch Website

This website is being created in order to review the course content obtained at the UTSA Coding Bootcamp. Basic HTML and CSS are utilized in this review exercise.

The Website will consist of various information pages that are easily accessed via navigation bar.

First repo push was after a few weeks of work and early work was not documented here.

“If we pray, we will believe; if we believe, we will love; if we love, we will serve. Only then we put our love of God into action.”
